**Take The Deal** is a multiplayer party game inspired by *Deal or No Deal*. Designed for 3‚Äì10 players, this game blends strategy and chance into a single hilarious, unpredictable experience.

## üçª Game Overview

Unlike the original *Deal or No Deal*, your goal in *Take The Deal* is to **collect the lowest or highest number of penalties**. The game flows similarly to multiplayer party games like *Piccolo*, encouraging group interaction, competition, and lots of laughs.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

### Game Setup
1. **Add Players**: Enter 3‚Äì10 player names. Click on names to remove them from the Player Setup List. Order will be randomly assigned at start.
2. **Select Modifier Setting** - Modifier types will be randomly picked at start:
   - **Low** ‚Äì 3 total modifiers
   - **Medium** ‚Äì 1/4 of total cases
   - **Volatile** ‚Äì 1/2 of total cases
3. The game generates a penalty list and shuffles them into randomly numbered cases.

### Gameplay Flow
Number of rounds
#### Round 0: Case Selection
- Each player chooses one case to keep until the end.

#### Rounds 1 to 7: Penalty Picking
- Each player takes turns choosing an unopened case and must accept the penalty inside, unless the case contains a modifier.
  - If a modifier is drawn, the player must follow the instruction shown

#### Final Round: Take or Leave
- Players choose to either:
  - **Take**: Open their own case and take the penalty.
  - **Leave**: Put their case back into the pool for someone else to potentially claim.

##### Endgame Scenarios
- **Everyone Takes Penalty**: The game ends with everyone taking their own penalties.
- **One Player Leaves Penalty**: That player must take their case.
- **Multiple Leave Penalties**: Remaining players take turns picking from the pool until one case remains.

## üåÄ Modifiers

## üìä Scoring

At the end of the game, players are ranked based on:
- **Most Penalties**
- **Least Penalties**
- **Max Penalty** (largest single penalty drawn)

This gives players multiple reasons to strategize ‚Äî whether to go big or stay safe!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanics

  - `Unopened`: Available to pick.
  - `Selected`: Chosen but not opened.
  - `Opened`: Revealed and resolved.
- **Player States**:
